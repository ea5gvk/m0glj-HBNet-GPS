# This GPS/APRS gateway project has morphed into HBNet. It is still under heavy development and not ready for production. You can see it [here](https://github.com/kf7eel/hblink3/tree/hbnet). This branch will be retired soon.

# GPS/Data Application

This repository contains everything needed to decode DMR GPS packets and SMS for HBLink3. This application can act as a master or peer and receive data as a group call or private call. It is designed to work in a multi system/user network.

Files modified from original master branch of HBLink3:

* bridge.py
* config.py 

#### Required modules

* pynmea2
* aprslib
* maidenhead

#### Optional Modules
* Flask - Required for dashboard
* smtplib - Required for sending email. If pip fails to install module, it may already be installed as most Linux distributions have this module by default.
* traceback - If pip fails to install module, it may already be installed as most Linux distrobutions have this module by default.
* slixmpp - Required for upcoming XMPP gateway.
* folium - Required for mapping on dashboard.

This should work for DMR radios that send location data as a UTF-8 NMEA sentence. I am hopping to add support for more radios in the future.

### Differences in branches

* **GPS**: Contains the GPS/Data Application.
* **aprs_features**: Contains the GPS/Data Application and a modified version of the APRS implementation for repeaters and hotspots by **IU7IGU**. (See [https://github.com/iu7igu/hblink3-aprs](https://github.com/iu7igu/hblink3-aprs) for his work). I combined these for convenience.

## Would like to test:

Connect Systems GPS enabled radios

## Features

* Decode GPS locations and upload APRS position packets
* Each user/DMR ID can customize APRS position
* Ability to receive data as a private call or group call
* Trigger a command or script via DMR SMS
* Optional web dashboard to show APRS packets uploaded
* Display bulletins sent via SMS on web dashboard


## How it works

A user should configure their radio for the DMR ID of the application and private or group call. When a position is received by the application, it will extract the coordinates and create an APRS position packet. The application will find the callsign of the user based on the sending radio's DMR ID. It is essential to have an up to date subscriber_ids file for this to work. A predefined APRS SSID is appended to the callsign. The APRS location packet is then uploaded to APRS-IS. No setup is required beforehand on the part of the user. This is pretty much "plug and play."

For example, N0CALL has a DMR ID of 1234567. N0CALL's radio sends a position to the application. The application will query the subscriber_ids file for DMR ID 1234567. The result will be N0CALL. An APRS location pack is created and uploaded to APRS-IS.

## Individual user/DMR ID APRS settings

By default, all APRS positions will have an SSID of 15, a default comment, and the callsign of the DMR user. These default settings can be changed. 

The comment, SSID, and icon can be set for each individual user/DMR ID the application sees. The application stores all the setting in a file. You may have different SSIDs, icons, and comments for different DMR IDs. This is done via DMR SMS using the following commands:

 | Command | Description | Example |
 |-------|:---:|:---:|
|**@SSID**|Change SSID of user callsign.|`@SSID 7`|
|**@ICON**|Change the icon of the APRS position. *See [http://aprs.net/vm/DOS/SYMBOLS.HTM](http://aprs.net/vm/DOS/SYMBOLS.HTM) for icon list.|`@icon /p`|
|**@COM**|Change the comment of the APRS.|`@COM This is a test comment.`|
|**@MH**|Set you location by maidenhead grid square. Designed for radios with no GPS or that are not compatable yet.|`@MH DN97uk`| 
|**@BB**|Post a bulliten to the web dashboard.|`@BB This is a test bulletin.`|
|**@[CALLSIGN W/ SSID] A-[MESSAGE]**|Send a message to another station via APRS.|`@N0CALL-15 A-This is a test.`|
|**[EMAIL ADDRESS] E-[MESSAGE]**|Send an email to an email address.|`test@example.org E-This is a test.`| 



Send a DMR SMS to the configured dmr_data_id in the application with the desired command followed by the value. For example, to change your icon to a dog, the command would be `@ICON /p` (see the icon table for values). Changing your SSID is as simple as `@SSID 7`, and `@COM Testing 123` will change the comment. 

Sending `@BB Test` will result in a post to the bulletin board with the messaage of "Test".


**To remove any of the stored values, just send the appropriate command without any input.** `@COM` will remove the stored comment, `@ICON` will remove the stored icon, and `@COM` will remove the strored comment. Any position now reports sent will have the default settings.


## Web Dashboard

The web dashboard is completely optional. Python module flask is required for this to work. The web dashboard will display the last 15 positions of radios sent to APRS-IS. The dashboard will also sh user bulletin. A bulletin is a message sent via SMS that will display on the web dashboard. There are several uses for this, including: testing SMS functionality of radio, announcements, and moire. It is a novel feature. The page will automatically reload every 2 minutes. Setup is rather simple. Just modify the example config in the dashboard directory and rename it to dashboard_settings.py. Then start dashboard.py. 

## APRS messaging

**At this time, only sending of messages from DMR SMS to APRS-IS is supported.** I find this feature very pointless because it will only go one way, but someone else may find it important. **Messages from sent from APRS-IS to DMR SMS will not work.** I have not written the code for this yet. It will likley be a long time before this is a possibility.

## APRS TOCALL

The project was granted a [tocall](http://www.aprs.org/aprs11/tocalls.txt) of **APHBLx** by Bob Bruniga, WB4APR. This will identify that your APRS position came from HBLink. The x on the end can be any letter/number. Here are the current designations of APHBLx:

* **APHBL3** - HBlink3 D-APRS gateway
* **APHBLD** - DMRlink D-APRS gateway (the IPSC version of the project)
* **_APHBLS_** - Planned, but not in use: HBLink3 via KISS TNC

## Configuration

See hblink_SAMPLE.cfg, rules_SAMPLE.py, and gps_data_SAMPLE.cfg for examples.

## Special thanks to:

**IU7IGU** - For creating APRS position beaconing for PEER connections.

**IV3JDV** - For helping debug SMS in Anytone radios.

**KD7LMN** - For pointing out a critical bug.

## PROJECT: Open Source HomeBrew Repeater Proctol Client/Master. ##

**UPDATES:**

**PURPOSE:** Thanks to the work of Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX; Hans Barthen, DL5DI; Torsten Shultze, DG1HT we have an open protocol for internetworking DMR repeaters. Unfortunately, there's no generic client and/or master stacks. This project is to build an open-source, python-based implementation. You are free to use this software however you want, however we ask that you provide attribution in some public venue (such as project, club, organization web site). This helps us see where the software is in use and track how it is used.

For those who will ask: This is a piece of software that implements an open-source, amateur radio networking protocol. It is not a network. It is not intended to be a network. It is not intended to replace or circumvent a network. People do those things, code doesn't.
  
**PROPERTY:**  
This work represents the author's interpretation of the HomeBrew Repeater Protocol, based on the 2015-07-26 documents from DMRplus, "IPSC Protocol Specs for homebrew DMR repeater" as written by Jonathan Naylor, G4KLX; Hans Barthen, DL5DI; Torsten Shultze, DG1HT, also licenced under Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license.

**WARRANTY**
None. The owners of this work make absolutely no warranty, express or implied. Use this software at your own risk.

**PRE-REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE:**  
This document assumes the reader is familiar with Linux/UNIX, the Python programming language and DMR.  

**Using docker version**

To work with provided docker setup you will need:
* A private repository with your configuration files (all .cfg files in repo will be copyed to the application root directory on start up)
* A service user able to read your private repository (or be brave and publish your configuration, or be really brave and give your username and password to the docker)
* A server with docker installed
* Follow this simple steps:

Build your own image from source

```bash

docker build . -t millaguie/hblink:3.0.0

```

Or user a prebuilt one in docker hub: millaguie/hblink:3.0.0

Wake up your container

```bash
touch /var/log/hblink.log
chown 65000  /var/log/hblink.log
 run -v /var/log/hblink.log:/var/log/hblink.log -e GIT_USER=$USER -e GIT_PASSWORD=$PASSWORD -e GIT_REPO=$URL_TO_REPO_WITHOUT_HTTPS://  -p 54000:54000  millaguie/hblink:3.0.0
 ```
