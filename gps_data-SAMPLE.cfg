# PROGRAM-WIDE PARAMETERS GO HERE
# PATH - working path for files, leave it alone unless you NEED to change it
# PING_TIME - the interval that peers will ping the master, and re-try registraion
#           - how often the Master maintenance loop runs
# MAX_MISSED - how many pings are missed before we give up and re-register
#           - number of times the master maintenance loop runs before de-registering a peer
#
# ACLs:
#
# Access Control Lists are a very powerful tool for administering your system.
# But they consume packet processing time. Disable them if you are not using them.
# But be aware that, as of now, the configuration stanzas still need the ACL
# sections configured even if you're not using them.
#
# REGISTRATION ACLS ARE ALWAYS USED, ONLY SUBSCRIBER AND TGID MAY BE DISABLED!!!
#
# The 'action' May be PERMIT|DENY
# Each entry may be a single radio id, or a hypenated range (e.g. 1-2999)
# Format:
# 	ACL = 'action:id|start-end|,id|start-end,....'
#		--for example--
#	SUB_ACL: DENY:1,1000-2000,4500-60000,17
#
# ACL Types:
# 	REG_ACL: peer radio IDs for registration (only used on HBP master systems)
# 	SUB_ACL: subscriber IDs for end-users
# 	TGID_TS1_ACL: destination talkgroup IDs on Timeslot 1
# 	TGID_TS2_ACL: destination talkgroup IDs on Timeslot 2
#
# ACLs may be repeated for individual systems if needed for granularity
# Global ACLs will be processed BEFORE the system level ACLs
# Packets will be matched against all ACLs, GLOBAL first. If a packet 'passes'
# All elements, processing continues. Packets are discarded at the first
# negative match, or 'reject' from an ACL element.
#
# If you do not wish to use ACLs, set them to 'PERMIT:ALL'
# TGID_TS1_ACL in the global stanza is used for OPENBRIDGE systems, since all
# traffic is passed as TS 1 between OpenBridges

# OPENBRIDGE INSTANCES - DUPLICATE SECTION FOR MULTIPLE CONNECTIONS
# OpenBridge is a protocol originall created by DMR+ for connection between an
# IPSC2 server and Brandmeister. It has been implemented here at the suggestion
# of the Brandmeister team as a way to legitimately connect HBlink to the
# Brandemiester network.
# It is recommended to name the system the ID of the Brandmeister server that
# it connects to, but is not necessary. TARGET_IP and TARGET_PORT are of the
# Brandmeister or IPSC2 server you are connecting to. PASSPHRASE is the password
# that must be agreed upon between you and the operator of the server you are
# connecting to. NETWORK_ID is a number in the format of a DMR Radio ID that
# will be sent to the other server to identify this connection.
# other parameters follow the other system types.
#
# ACLs:
# OpenBridge does not 'register', so registration ACL is meaningless.
# Proper OpenBridge passes all traffic on TS1.
# HBlink can extend OPB to use both slots for unit calls only.
# Setting "BOTH_SLOTS" True ONLY affects unit traffic!
# Otherwise ACLs work as described in the global stanza
